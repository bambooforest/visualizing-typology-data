# Visualizing typological data on maps using Voronoi tessellation

This is an example of how to visualize typological data on world maps using Voronoi tessellation using R and a chapter from [WALS](http://wals.info/). The code has been extended to work with [Cross-Linguistic Data Formats (CLDF)](http://cldf.clld.org/) and is provided as a recipe in the [CLDF Cookbook](https://github.com/cldf/cookbook/tree/master/recipes/cldf_r), so that users can visualize any CLDF data set.

A full description of our visualization approach and reasoning is provided in:
